      "Ryan Gosling is, in a word, brilliant as the conflicted Daniel.\n",
      "If Deuces Wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure, one of those movies that's so bad it starts to become good.\n",
      "The film's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film's production design.\n",
      "Frida is certainly no disaster, but neither is it the Kahlo movie Frida fans have been looking for.\n",
      "The film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry.\n",
      "A work of astonishing delicacy and force.\n",
      "The movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane, carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh.\n",

      "But if you've paid a matinee price and bought a big tub of popcorn, there's guilty fun to be had here.\n",

      "The acting is stiff, the story lacks all trace of wit, the sets look like they were borrowed from Gilligan's Island -- and the CGI Scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year.\n",
      "This version moves beyond the original's nostalgia for the communal film experiences of yesteryear to a deeper realization of cinema's inability to stand in for true, lived experience.\n",
      "There's no palpable chemistry between Lopez and male lead Ralph Fiennes, plus the script by Working Girl scribe Kevin Wade is workmanlike in the extreme.\n",
      "A first-class, thoroughly involving B movie that effectively combines two surefire, beloved genres -- the prison flick and the fight film.\n",

      "The film seems a dead weight.\n",
      "Sparkling, often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy... Attal looks so much like a young Robert DeNiro that it seems the film should instead be called `My Husband Is Travis Bickle'.\n",
      "I did go back and check out the last 10 minutes, but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes.\n",
      "A lousy movie that's not merely unwatchable, but also unlistenable.\n",
      "One of the best films of the year with its exploration of the obstacles to happiness faced by five contemporary individuals... a psychological masterpiece.\n",
      "A strong script, powerful direction and splendid production design allows us to be transported into the life of Wladyslaw Szpilman, who is not only a pianist, but a good human being.\n",

      "Like a documentary version of Fight Club, shorn of social insight, intellectual pretension and cinematic interest.\n",
      "Stephen Rea, Aidan Quinn, and Alan Bates play Desmond's legal eagles, and when joined by Brosnan, the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty Irish settings is a pleasant enough thing, `tis.\n",
      "It's a powerful though flawed movie, guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming Washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today.\n",
      "An intriguing and entertaining introduction to Johnson.\n",
      "Everything was as superficial as the forced New Jersey lowbrow accent Uma had.\n",

      "Only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives, still with the boiler suit and white mask, which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry.\n",
      "Showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant ``if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns, the movie will be funny'' syndrome.\n",
      "Whatever heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini DV, they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck.\n",

      "It has fun with the quirks of family life, but it also treats the subject with fondness and respect.\n",
      "Novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty, no-budget approach.\n",
      "Since Lee is a sentimentalist, the film is more worshipful than your random E!\n",
      "The movie is almost completely lacking in suspense, surprise and consistent emotional conviction.\n",
      "High Crimes knows the mistakes that bad movies make and is determined not to make them, and maybe that is nobility of a sort.\n",
      "But it's too long and too convoluted and it ends in a muddle.\n",
      "This thing works on no level whatsoever for me.\n",
      "... a bland murder-on-campus yawner.\n",
      "In comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class London life; despite the title... amounts to surprisingly little.\n",
      "One of the finest, most humane and important Holocaust movies ever made.\n",
      "Suffers from rambling, repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video.\n",
      "The twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance, but twists are getting irritating, and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows.\n",
      "Angel presents events partly from the perspective of Aurelie and Christelle, and infuses the film with the sensibility of a particularly nightmarish fairytale.\n",
      "Features one of the most affecting depictions of a love affair ever committed to film.\n",
      "It is intensely personal and yet -- unlike Quills -- deftly shows us the temper of the times.\n",

      "... a solid, well-formed satire.\n",
      "Deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits.\n",
      "Read My Lips is to be viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality as well as its lyrical variations on the game of love.\n",

      "Reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish.\n",
      "Just how these families interact may surprise you.\n",
      "The Movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size, and it ain't pretty.\n",
      "Even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of Job to get through this interminable, shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture.\n",
      "Creepy, authentic and dark.\n",
      "A lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her.\n",
      "Rob Schneider's infantile cross-dressing routines fill The Hot Chick, the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian.\n",
      "The film is a contrivance, as artificial as the video games Japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence, but it's an enjoyable one.\n",
      "At its worst the screenplay is callow, but at its best it is a young artist's thoughtful consideration of fatherhood.\n",
      "At 78 minutes it just zings along with vibrance and warmth.\n",
      "Only an epic documentary could get it all down, and Spike Lee's Jim Brown: All American at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents.\n",

      "Instead of hiding Pinocchio from critics, Miramax should have hidden it from everyone.\n",

      "Just about the best straight-up, old-school horror film of the last 15 years.\n",
      "Gosling creates a staggeringly compelling character, a young man whose sharp intellect is at the very root of his contradictory, self-hating, self-destructive ways.\n",
      "I thought the relationships were wonderful, the comedy was funny, and the love `real'.\n",
      "Better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine.\n",
      "Feels less like a cousin to Blade Runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the Escape From New York series.\n",
      "Elegantly produced and expressively performed, the six musical numbers crystallize key plot moments into minutely detailed wonders of dreamlike ecstasy.\n",
      "Ultimate X is a ride, basically the kind of greatest-hits reel that might come with a subscription to ESPN the Magazine.\n",
      "Celebrated at Sundance, this slight comedy of manners has winning performances and a glossy, glib charm that's hard to beat.\n",
      "Apparently, romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just doesn't figure in the present Hollywood program.\n",
      "That Haynes can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace.\n",
      "Some elements of it really blow the big one, but other parts are decent.\n",
      "No French people were harmed during the making of this movie, but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half.\n",

      "It's 51 times better than this.\n",
      "It's like an old Warner Bros. costumer jived with sex -- this could be the movie Errol Flynn always wanted to make, though Bette Davis, cast as Joan, would have killed him.\n",
      "A miraculous movie, I'm Going Home is so slight, yet overflows with wisdom and emotion.\n",
      "A fiercely clever and subtle film, capturing the precarious balance between the extravagant confidence of the exiled aristocracy and the cruel earnestness of the victorious revolutionaries.\n",
      "It's as if you're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak, and it has been unearthed and released now, when it has become even weaker.\n",

      "For those for whom the name Woody Allen was once a guarantee of something fresh, sometimes funny, and usually genuinely worthwhile, Hollywood Ending is a depressing experience.\n",
      "Bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies.\n",
      "The fun of the movie is the chance it affords to watch Jackson, who also served as executive producer, take his smooth, shrewd, powerful act abroad.\n",
      "What should have been a cutting Hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week's issue of Variety.\n",
      "Cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos, but there are no movies of Nijinsky, so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge.\n",
